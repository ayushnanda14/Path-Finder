# Path-Finder
An implementation of a path finder in a search space of randomly generated polygons. And analsyed different graph search algorithms. 
## graphPlotters.py
This module is used to plot all the necessary functions, paths and shapes onto graphs. Implemented using matplotlib.pyplot.
## search.py
This module contains all the graph search algorithms used in this project.
## utils.py
This module contains all the necessary utility functions like euclidean distance, random shuffle and etc.
## randomGraphGen.py
This module generates a search space for an instance, with random shapes created from a convex hull.
## search_space.py
This module generates the visibility graph for the given 2D search space.
## path_finder.py
This is the main program file which contains the main class that runs various searches from the search.py file.
